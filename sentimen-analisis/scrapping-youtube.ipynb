From their childhood in a way to modern times in other ways. Kim jong UN, wasn't as apriceatet by his father, had a hard life in his childhood from the social point of view, whilst his sister was the \"prodigy\" the loved one.. the talented. Also her expression is very similar to Azula's. Evil, cold, inteligent. And always knows something important than nobody else knows.   \n",
